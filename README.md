# Administration
## Steps to get started:
1. Navigate to the `ProjectUmbrella-Code` root directory
2. Run a local server via `python manage.py runserver`
  - Note 1: On Ubuntu you may have to specify python3 explicitly: `python3 manage.py runserver`
  - Note 2: You can tell the server to run on a port different to the default (which is Port 8000) by using: `python manage.py runserver 8080`
3. Current valid directories include:
  - url = `localhost:8000` for the umbrella application
  - url = `localhost:8000/polls` for polls application
  - url = `localhost:8000/admin`  for administration


## Register a 'Superuser' account
You will probably need a superuser account on the django admin panel at some point so:
1. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create super user.
2. Follow the prompts.

# Umbrella application
Currently the Umbrella app points to the root of the webserver e.g. on localhost it is `127.0.0.1:8000`. You should be greeted by the index page (index.html duh).

## Node Package Manager (npm)
We'll be using npm to manage packages and dependencies e.g. Bootstrap - hich is what we will use to style our HTML with.
It uses a `packages.json` file to keep track of package versions used, much the same as the `requirements.txt` file that is used by Python to keep track of package versioning to ensure consistency.

To download `npm` on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install npm
```
On Mac: [Visit this article](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)

Navigate to the `ProjectUmbrella-Code` root directory and run `npm install` and npm will install the dependencies from the `packages.json` file.

### Dependencies & `packages.json`
Not going to re-invent the wheel, here is the npm documentation on [getting started with `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) and more detailed stuff on specifying dependencies [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)

## Bootstrap
Bootstrap has some really good demos/examples that can be found [here](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)

## Postgresql Set up
Haven't done this yet, been looking here to start off with: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04

## GeoDjango
